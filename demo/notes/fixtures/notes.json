I thought that got most of it right.\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be one of the most widely photographed spacecraft in history. That was no doubt due to the fact that it was so photogenic. Equally responsible for its success was its characteristic of hiding from view its ugly occupant.\r\n\r\nIts true beauty, however, was that it worked. It was tough, reliable and almost cuddly.\r\n\r\nTo all of you who made it all that it was, I send a quarter century's worth of thanks and congratulations.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n(Signed) Neil A.
